Python: Python is a popular, easy-to-learn programming language used for:
1.Data Analysis (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy)
2.Visualization (using Matplotlib, Seaborn)
3.Web Development (Django, Flask)
4.Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
5.Automation and Scripting


Pandas: Pandas is a powerful Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It allows you to easily load, clean, filter, and summarize data — just like working with spreadsheets, but inside Python. With Pandas, we can quickly explore patterns in the invoice data, such as finding average billing amounts, grouping shipments by zone, or identifying trends in shipping weights.


Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It offers a wide range of plotting functionalities, including line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and 3D plots. It is a versatile tool for data visualization in Python, widely used by data scientists, researchers, and engineers. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, IPython shells, web application servers, and GUI toolkits.


Seaborn: Seaborn is a powerful Python library built on top of Matplotlib, designed for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. It excels at visualizing relationships and distributions within datasets, offering a high-level interface for plotting with default styles and color palettes. Seaborn is particularly useful for exploring and understanding data by providing dataset-oriented APIs that allow you to switch between different visual representations of the same variables.
