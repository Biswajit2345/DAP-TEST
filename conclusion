Invoice Data Analysis

1.Data Overview :
The dataset contains 100 entries with 8 columns including shipment details like AWB code, order ID, charged weight, pincodes, zone, shipment type, and billing amount.
All fields are complete (no missing values).


2.Billing Amount Variation :
Billing amounts range from ₹33 to ₹403.8, showing a wide variation based on weight, distance, and shipment type.
Shipments with "Forward and RTO charges" generally have higher billing due to return logistics.


3.Zone Distribution :
Zone d accounts for the majority of shipments.
Zones b and e also appear but less frequently.


4.Average Billing by Zone :
Zone e has the highest average billing amount, likely due to long-distance delivery or added services.
Zone b shows lower average costs compared to other zones.


5.Customer Insights :
No customer-specific data available beyond pincode, limiting detailed customer behavior analysis.
Adding customer demographics in future datasets could enhance insights.


6.Future Recommendations :
Implement RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) analysis if order history is available.
Use machine learning models to predict shipping costs based on weight, zone, and shipment type.
Introduce visual dashboards for real-time tracking of billing trends and shipment performance.
